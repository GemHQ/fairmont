# General Purpose Functions

    {describe, assert} = require "./helpers"

    describe "General functions", (context) ->

## abort

Simple wrapper around `process.exit(-1)`.

      abort = (message) ->
        console.error message if message?
        process.exit -1

      context.test "abort"

## memoize

A very simple way to cache results of functions that take a single argument. Also takes an optional hash function that defaults to calling `toString` on the function's argument.

      memoize = do (_hash = undefined) ->
        _hash = (x) -> x.toString()
        (fn, hash = _hash, memo = {}) ->
          (x) -> memo[hash x] ?= fn x

      context.test "memoize"

## timer

Set a timer. Takes an interval in microseconds and an action. Returns a function to cancel the timer. Basically, a more convenient way to call `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`.

      timer = (wait, action) ->
        id = setTimeout(action, wait)
        -> clearTimeout( id )
      context.test "timer"

## sleep

Returns a promise that yields after a given interval.

      sleep = (interval) ->
        {promise} = require "when"
        promise (resolve, reject) ->
          timer interval, -> resolve()

      context.test "sleep"


## shell

Execute a shell command. Returns a promise that resolves to an object with properties `stdout` and `stdin`, or is rejected with an error.

      shell = (command) ->
        {promise} = require "when"
        {exec} = require "child_process"
        promise (resolve, reject) ->
          exec command, (error, stdout, stderr) ->
            if error
              reject error
            else
              resolve {stdout, stderr}

      context.test "shell", ->
        assert (yield shell "ls ./test").stdout.trim?

## times

Run a function N number of times.

      {curry} = require "./core"
      times = curry (fn, n) -> fn() until n-- == 0

      context.test "times", ->
        do (n = 0) ->
          assert (times (-> ++n), 3).length == 3


## benchmark

Run a function an record how long it took. Use this in conjunction with `times` to benchmark a function over N repetitions.

      {Method} = require "./multimethods"
      {isFunction} = require "./type"
      {async} = require "./generator"

      benchmark = Method.create()

      Method.define benchmark, isFunction, (fn) ->
        start = Date.now()
        fn()
        Date.now() - start

      context.test "benchmark"

## empty

Returns true if a contains no value. For arrays and strings, this means that its length is zero. For an object, it means that `keys` returns an array of length zero. For any other value, it will return true unless it's `undefined`.

      {keys} = require "./object"
      {isArray, isString, isObject} = require "./type"
      {blank} = require "./string"
      empty = (x) ->
        if isArray x
          x.length == 0
        else if isObject x
          empty keys x
        else if isString x
          blank x
        else
          !x?

      context.test "empty", ->
        assert empty []
        assert empty ""
        assert empty {}
        assert ! empty [1]
        assert ! empty "abc"
        assert ! empty a: 0
        assert empty undefined
        assert ! empty true

## length

Returns the length property of an object. This is so frequently used with strings and arrays that it's reasonable to include it. We were tempted to add a variant for objects, but that could produce surprising results. Instead, just use `length keys object`, which is still much more readable than `Object.keys(foo).length`. And, of course, if you're just comparing to zero, use `empty`: `empty foo` works on objects.

      length = (x) -> x.length

      context.test "length", -> assert (length []) == 0
