# Fairmont

A collection of useful CoffeeScript/JavaScript functions. These include functions to help with functional programming, arrays, objects, and more. Fairmont is inspired by [Underscore][100], [EssentialJS][110], and [prelude.coffee][120].

## Why Fairmont?

Fairmont offers a combination of features we couldn't find in existing libraries:

* Functional programming friendly
* ES6 aware (in particular, uses promises and generators for async operations)
* Comprehensive

Fairmont is also a literate programming projectâ€”the documentation, code, examples, and tests are together, making it easy to see what a function does, how it does it, and why it does it that particular way.

### Functional Programming Friendly

Fairmont is built on a functional programming foundation, including implementations for currying, partial application, and composition. Most functions are curried by default and designed with composition in mind.

### ES6 Aware

Fairmont wraps common asynchronous operations so they can be used in `yield` expressions. For example, here's how you can read a file using Fairmont.

```coffee
content = yield read "war-and-peace.txt"
```

### Comprehensive

One of the nice things about Underscore is that it offers a lot of useful functions. Many common tasks can be written entirely using Underscore functions. Fairmont has a similar ambition. While there's nothing wrong with specialized libraries, there are times when you just want a good Swiss Army Knife.

## Status

Fairmont is still under heavy development and is `alpha` quality, meaning you should probably not use it in your production code.

## Roadmap

You can get an idea of what we're planning by looking at the [issues list][200]. If you want something that isn't there, and you think it would be a good addition, please open a ticket.

Our overarching goals for the project include:

* Making the library more comprehensive

* Improving the tests and documentation

* Ensuring that we can use an FP style in real-world scenarios

* Introducing an idiom for supporting lazy evaluation
